    <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
    <p class="firstpara"><strong>Ishwar Chand Pandey</strong>,A small-town boy who started his journey to pursue cricket as a profession after his 12th and now the whole world knows him. In the world of cricket, it is considered to be a late start professionally but Ishwar Pandey has inspired uncountable number of youngsters to follow there dream and work for their passion. He is not only one of best fast bowler ever but he is the kindest person I have ever meet. In Rewa, hometown of Ishwar bhaiya, every player knows the value of his presence.
        And we all want the best for such a great personality.
        . </p>

<h2 id="why">#FanMoment</h2>
<p class="secondpara">My first encounter with Ishwar bhaiya is quiet embarrassing, when we first meet on an evening, second day of under-15 trials, I was not selected for the next stage of trial and Ishwar bhaiya walked in the ground and then me and some other player gathered around bhaiya crying about not getting selected and he kept telling us so humbly to try next year and work hard.
    Then I worked hard and after my second meet he started recognizing me and he helped me a lot I mean a lot,
    I was his favourite afterallüòÅ.
    I was not able to achieve my dream but I learn a lot of things from cricket that I imply on my life which makes it even better.
    And at the end I would like to say <br><strong>‚ÄúThank you Ishwar Bhaiya for everything‚Äù</strong>
